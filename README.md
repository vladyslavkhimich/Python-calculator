## I have learnt
* Python basics
* Creating GUI with PyQt5
* Convert numbers in different calculus systems
* Implementing Reverse Polish Notation(RPN)
## Getting started
To use the application, firstly, you will need to copy the entire repository. Open command prompt, go to the folder where you would like to store files and write:
```
git clone https://github.com/vladyslavkhimich/Python-calculator.git
```
To run the calculator you must have any Python 3 version, installed C++ Tools that you can install via Visual Studio Build Tools (You can find this program on Microsoft site with this link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) and installed PyQt5 package. To install PyQt5 run following command in command prompt in Windows:
```
py -m pip install pyqt5
```
If you are UNIX system user, use following command in terminal: 
```
sudo pip3 install PyQt5
```
Remember that for ability to install package any version of Python 3 must be installed on your computer!
## Built with
* Python 3.8
* PyQt5
* PyQt Designer
